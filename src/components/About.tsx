              At Kabir's Store, we believe that furniture is more than just functional piecesâ€”
              it's an expression of your personality and a foundation for life's most precious moments. 
              For over three decades, we've been dedicated to creating exceptional furniture that 
              combines traditional craftsmanship with contemporary design.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              Every piece in our collection tells a story of meticulous attention to detail, 
              sustainable practices, and unwavering commitment to quality. From the selection 
              of premium materials to the final finishing touches, we ensure that each item 
              meets our exacting standards.
